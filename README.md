## ‚ú® Features

- üéØ 16-bit ADC resolution
- üå°Ô∏è Integrated temperature sensor
- üîÑ Configurable sampling rates (8SPS to 860SPS)
- ‚ö° Multiple programmable gain amplifier (PGA) settings
- üîå SPI interface support
- üìä Differential and single-ended input modes
- üîß Easy-to-use Python interface

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 DEV KIT V1
- ADS1118 ADC
- Connection wires

## üîå Pin Configuration

| ESP32 Pin | ADS1118 Pin | Description |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| D5        | CS0         | Chip Select |
| D22       | CS1         | Chip Select |
| D18       | SCK         | SPI Clock   |
| D19       | MISO        | SPI MISO    |

## üì¶ Installation

1. Copy the `ads1118.py` file to your ESP32 device
2. Import the driver in your MicroPython code:

```python
from ads1118 import ADS1118
```

## üíª Usage Examples

### Basic Voltage Reading
```python
from ads1118 import ADS1118

# Initialize the ADC with default settings
# corresponds to D5 = SPI-CS0 on ESP32
adc = ADS1118()  # inputs= IN0 & IN1 (differentail)

# Read voltage from AIN0_AIN1 
voltage, raw, scale = adc.readData()
# gives a tuple of voltage in V, raw value and the input-scale 
print(f"Voltage: {voltage:.3f}V, Raw: {raw}, Scale: {scale}") 

# A more detailed definition could make the 4 inputs to 2 pair full differential
# All "commands" for the operation (e.g. high-speed sampling, gain settings)
# must be done in this object. 
adc = ads1118.ADS1118(D22, [MUX_AIN0_AIN1,MUX_AIN2_AIN3])

# Read voltage from first pair AIN0_AIN1
voltage, raw, scale = adc.readData(mux=ADS1118.MUX_AIN0)
# Read voltage from second pair MUX_AIN2_AIN3
voltage2, raw2, scale = adc.readData(mux=ADS1118.MUX_AIN0)
print(f"Voltage: {voltage:.3f}V, Raw: {raw}, Scale: {scale}")
```

### Temperature Reading
```python
from ads1118 import ADS1118

# Initialize the ADC
adc = ADS1118(D5)

# Read temperature (you need to overwrite the default tsMode)
temp, raw, scale = adc.readData(tsMode=ADS1118.TS_MODE_TEMP)
print(f"Temperature: {temp:.1f}¬∞C")
```

## üìä Complete Example with Error Handling
```python
from ads1118 import ADS1118
import time

def read_sensors(adc):
    try:
        # Read temperature
        temp, raw_temp, scale = adc.readData(tsMode=ADS1118.TS_MODE_TEMP)
        print(f"Temperature: {temp:.1f}¬∞C")
        
        # Read differential voltage
        diff_voltage, raw_diff, scale = adc.readData(mux=0, pga=PGA_0_512V, scale=SCALE_0_512V)
        print(f"Differential Voltage 1-2: {diff_voltage:.3f}V")
        
        # Read voltage on In2
        voltage2, raw_voltage2, scale2 = adc.readData(mux=1, pga=PGA_4_096V, scale=SCALE_4_096V)
        print(f"Voltage 2: {voltage2:.3f}V")

        # Read voltage on In3
        voltage3, raw_voltage3, scale3 = adc.readData(mux=2, pga=PGA_4_096V, scale=SCALE_4_096V)
        print(f"Voltage 3: {voltage3:.3f}V")        
        
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error reading sensors: {e}")
        # Reset the ADC if needed
        machine.reset()

# Initialize the ADC
adc = ads1118.ADS1118(D5, [MUX_AIN0_AIN1,MUX_AIN2,MUX_AIN3]) # diff and single-ended

# Main loop
while True:
    read_sensors(adc)
    time.sleep(1)  # Read every second
